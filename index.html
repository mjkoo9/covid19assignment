      <!-- Our story -->
      <div class="container">
        <p>Epidemiologists held a Coronavirus briefing for preventing New Yorkers overreacting to the Coronavirus outbreak.</p>

        <p>Medical experts from the big three hospitals in New York City provided accurate information for New Yorkers at Hunter College, in Upper East Side, New York City, on Mar. 4, 2020. The briefing was about the self-protection from Coronavirus, which is recently renamed as COVID-19. It was organized by Suraj Patel, a candidate for New York's 12th Congressional District in the U.S. House, and three doctors from NYU Langone Health, The Mount Sinai Hospital, and Sinai Columbia University Medical Center.</p>

        <p>The City Mayor Bill de Blasio urged New Yorkers to work at home this Monday after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo confirmed the first patient on Mar. 1, 2020. While Coronavirus spreads out through nationwide, New York State has among the hightest number in the country: over 140 cases. Columbia University shut down on Mar. 8, 2020, and many companies including Buzzfeed made their employees to telecommute. Patel planned the Coronavirus briefing to soothe rising anxiety in New York.</p>

        <p>"We are wasting our sources by not asking to experts," said Patel. "Panic-striken people stock groceries and hand sanitizers with underinformation."</p>

        <p>Dr. Susan Michaels-Strasser, an epidemiologist from Columiba University Medical Center said that it is not right to contain current Coronavirus outbreak the same measures with SARS outbreak in 2003.</p>

        <p>"The world is vastly different now," said Michaels-Strasser. "Think about how much our system got stronger."</p>

        <p>Through the briefing, New Yorkers asked about the medical supports for homeless people, zenophobia against East Asians, and ways for self-protection.</p>

        <p>Dr. Amelia Boehme from Columbia University Neuroloy Department, advises citizens not to go directly to the hospital before calling the doctor when they have coronavirus symptoms. "You can pass the virus on other people in the hospital," said Boehme. "Stay at home and call your doctor first."</p>

        <p>Dr. Dahlia Rizh from Mt.Sinai Hospital also emphasized to ask experts and find reliable information first before getting bewildered. The importance of washing hands was brought up again and again by the doctors.</p>

        <p>"Actually, washing your hands and not touching your face is the daily rule of health," said Boehme. "Also, shave your beard."</p>

        <p>All doctors said that wearing masks is not recommendable to people who don't have the virus. "It's not like SARS outbreak in 2013. The world if vastly changed," said Dr. Susan Michaels-Strasser. "Thank about how much our system got strongger."</p>

        <p>Although experts showed pretty firm confidence about their abilities to handle the outbreak, they also explained that there is the lack of test kits when a citizen asked why doctors do not test people without symtoms. There are several cases in South Korea and Italy that virus carriers do not show any symtoms. Especially, healthy people in their 20s or 30s often have no fever or cough, but they can pass the virus on to comparatively weak people like children or senior citizens.</p>

        <p>"We have to deal with this shortage of test kits, medical experts, and budgets at the national level with experts," said Patel. "Now, nobody trys to listen to experts."</p>
